# LP-Finding-limiting-Rxns
LP Problem implemented in MATLAB that help us to identify the Enzymatic Reactions that we must relaxe their bounds in order to achieve the experimental Growth Rate on certain growth conditions.

I showed the example (see data directory for more info) where we simulate growth on CH condition using SMM condition as Baseline
