We provide the metabolic model and arguments for the function Finding_limitingrxns.m that will simulate growth on CH at different growth rates. Also, the function will return the reactions whose bounds where relaxed in order to achieve the experimental growth rate on CH.

iBsu1103 metabolic model: gb-2009-10-6-r69-s4.xml
gr : growth rates vector
lb : Lower bound vector (Vmin * GeX_ratio)
ub : Upper bound vector (Vmax * GeX_ratio)
enz_rxns : Vector with the Identifiers of all the Enzymatic Rxns
