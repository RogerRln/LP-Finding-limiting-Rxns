We provide the metabolic model and the inputs for the example case of growth on CH using SMM as Baseline at different growth rates. The matlab function will find the reactions whose bounds need to be relaxed in order to achieve the corresponding fixed growth rate.

enzymatic_rxns_and_bounds.xlsx File with three columns:
enzymatic-rxn IDs : Vector with the Identifiers of all the Enzymatic Rxns
lower bound : Lower bound vector (Vmin * GeX_ratio)
upper bound : Upper bound vector (Vmax * GeX_ratio)

growth_rates_vector.txt File with one column:
Growth rates: the column contains a list of growth rates in ascending order, the Finding_limitingrxns.m function iterates over this list finding reactions whose bounds need to be relaxed in order to achieve the corresponding fixed growth rate.
