We provide the metabolic model and inputs of the function Finding_limitingrxns.m that simulates growth on CH at different growth rates. The function will find the reactions that need to be relaxed in order to achieve the fixed growth rate.

enzymatic_rxns_and_bounds.xlsx File with three columns:
enzymatic-rxn IDs : Vector with the Identifiers of all the Enzymatic Rxns
lower bound : Lower bound vector (Vmin * GeX_ratio)
upper bound : Upper bound vector (Vmax * GeX_ratio)

growth_rates_vector.txt File with one column:
Growth rates: this column contains a list of growth rates in ascending order, the Finding_limitingrxns.m function iterates over this list finding reactions whose bounds need to be relaxed in order to achieve the corresponding fixed growth rate. The last element of this vector is the experimental growth rate of CH.
