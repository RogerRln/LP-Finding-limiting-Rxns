For this example we are going to simulate Growth on CH (rich medium) using SMM (poor medium) as Baseline. We provide the following data that workinputs for the function are:
gr : growth rates vector
lb : Lower bound (Vmin * GeX_ratio) vector
ub : Upper bound (Vmax * GeX_ratio) vector
Optimization : {1,2}
