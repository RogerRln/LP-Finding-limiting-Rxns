We provide the metabolic model and arguments for the function OptimizedGrowth.m that will simulate growth on CH using a poor medium (SMM) as Baseline. Also, the function will return the reactions that where relaxed in order to achieve the experimental growth rate on CH.

gr : growth rates vector
lb : Lower bound vector (Vmin * GeX_ratio)
ub : Upper bound vector (Vmax * GeX_ratio)
enz_rxns : Vector with the Identifiers of all the Enzymatic Rxns
