For this example we are going to simulate Growth on CH (rich medium) using SMM (poor medium) as Baseline. We provide the following input data.

iBsu1103 metabolic model: gb-2009-10-6-r69-s4.xml
gr : growth rates vector
lb : Lower bound vector (Vmin * GeX_ratio)
ub : Upper bound vector (Vmax * GeX_ratio)
